# Training Days
Training Days is a service that sends its users a message for the event they signed up for and the days they have left to train.

Training Days has asked you to help them solve a problem: The program currently uses the wrong scope for its variables. They know this can be troublesome as their service evolves. In this project you will make Training Days more maintainable and less error-prone by fixing variable scopes.
